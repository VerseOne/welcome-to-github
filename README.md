Welcome to Github
===

As discussed I have set this project up for you guys to fork and get 
to know git with. I would suggest learning the basics of git by 
following some of [Git immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/) guide
then make some changes, add some files and submit a pull request or 
play around with raising an issue.

Oh yeah and don't forget to have a look around the help section right
here [help!])http://help.github.com/).

Also look at [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
for creating these readme files.

Happy Githubbing!
